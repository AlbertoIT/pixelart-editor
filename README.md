# Pixelart editor

Demo - <http://akash.im/stuff/pixelart-editor/index.html>


## Development

You'll need [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org) to build this yourself.

Clone the repo, compile the `js/pixelpad.coffee` to javascript and open index.html :)

If you are impatient, just copy-paste this into your terminal

    git clone https://github.com/HashNuke/pixelart-editor.git    
    cd pixelart-editor && coffee -c js/pixelpad.coffee
    open index.html


## Why build this thing?

Pixel art fan here. Labor of love.
